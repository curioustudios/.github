## 🚀 Our projects
Some of our notable projects include:

### 🚜 Stytsko
A Discord bot that saves your messages and makes others from them with advanced settings, commands and generation algorithms. **Private**
#### 🚜✈ Stytsko Telegram
Same thing as its Discord counterpart, but in Telegram. Still in beta and very experimental, in early stages of development. **Private**
#### 🚜1️⃣ [Stytsko v1](https://github.com/curioustudios/stytsko-v1)
The earliest ever version of Stytsko. No commands, simple to use and host. [Repository](https://github.com/curioustudios/stytsko-v1)

### ✨ Ukrainian Pidpilla
The official Discord bot for the community Ukrainian Pidpilla, formerly known as "UAGD". It has unfortunately been shut down. The bot is not planned to go open-source. **Private**

### 🈵 [Translation API](https://github.com/curioustudios/translation-api)
We actually made a simple express-based translation API using the [@vitalets/google-translate-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitalets/google-translate-api) package, which uses the [Google Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest). [Repository](https://github.com/curioustudios/translation-api)

### ⛓ [markovchain.js](https://github.com/curioustudios/markovchain.js) (⚠)
